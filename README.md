# SentinelWall

SentinelWall : An AI-Powered Web Application Firewall That Gets Smarter With Every Attack. Built for developers and security teams tired of outdated rules and constant manual updates.Blocks malicious inputs like XSS, SQLi, command injections, and still figuring out other types of DOM based payload attacks.

This version : 
Uses AI model to detect obfuscated or sneaky payloads
Decodes and sanitizes deeply encoded data
Logs every attempt (clean or malicious) for analysis
Generates visual threat reports (HTML + PDF)
Retrains its detection model automatically, in real-time
Plugs into existing apps via lightweight middleware or API

what i am planning of doing next:
Learn attacker patterns and adapt without human intervention
Real-time dashboards with live threat analytics
Auto-block repeated offender IPs
Daily email reports to admins
Integrate with external threat feeds
Honeypot mode to trap and study advanced payloads
Eventually scale into a cloud-native threat intelligence layer

It's lightweight. It learns. And it works.
